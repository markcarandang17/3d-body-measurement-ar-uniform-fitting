# Detailed Implementation Plan for 3D Body Measurement & AR School Uniform Fitting

This project will add a new feature that allows users to capture their body image using their device camera, process the image on a Python FastAPI backend using OpenCV/MediaPipe for measurements, and then display a 3D school uniform fitting simulation using Three.js. Below is a step-by-step outline of all dependent changes and file updates.

---

## 1. Project Setup & Dependencies

- **Backend Directory:**  
  • Create a new folder named `backend` at the project root.  
  • Create a `requirements.txt` inside `backend` with:  
  ```plaintext
  fastapi
  uvicorn
  opencv-python
  mediapipe
  python-multipart
  ```
- **Python Environment:**  
  • Setup a virtual environment and install dependencies.  

---

## 2. Python FastAPI Backend Implementation

- **File:** `backend/main.py`  
  • Import FastAPI, CORS, File, and UploadFile.  
  • Create `/api/measure` endpoint that accepts an image file, processes it (mock or use OpenCV/MediaPipe for measurements), and returns JSON data with measurements (e.g., height, shoulder width).  
  • Implement detailed error handling (check if file is uploaded, try/except for failure, log errors).  
  • Example snippet:
  ```python
  from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile, HTTPException
  from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
  
  app = FastAPI()
  app.add_middleware(
      CORSMiddleware,
      allow_origins=["*"],
      allow_methods=["*"],
      allow_headers=["*"],
  )
  
  @app.post("/api/measure")
  async def measure_body(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
      if not file:
          raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="No file uploaded")
      try:
          # Process image using OpenCV / MediaPipe here (placeholder)
          results = {"height": 170, "shoulderWidth": 45}
          return results
      except Exception as e:
          raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Processing error: {e}")
  
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      import uvicorn
      uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001)
  ```
- **Testing:**  
  • Use curl:  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/measure" -F "file=@/path/to/test.jpg"
  ```

## 3. Next.js Frontend Integration

### New Route for Fitting Feature

- **File:** `src/app/fitting/page.tsx`  
  • Create a new page with a modern, multi-step wizard UI (steps: instructions, camera preview, processing state, results).  
  • Use Tailwind CSS for spacing, typography, and layout.  
  • Provide error messages and loading spinner states.

### UI Components & Functionality

- **Camera Preview Component:**  
  - **File:** `src/app/fitting/CameraPreview.tsx`  
  - Uses `getUserMedia` to access the webcam and displays a live feed.  
  - Incorporate plain text instructions and a “Capture Image” button.

- **Measurement Result Display:**  
  - **File:** `src/app/fitting/MeasurementResult.tsx`  
  - Displays measurement values from the backend with clear typography and spacing.  
  - Includes error messages if the measurement process fails.

- **3D Uniform Viewer (Three.js):**  
  - **File:** `src/app/fitting/Uniform3DViewer.tsx`  
  - Dynamically import Three.js to render a basic 3D model (e.g., a box or simplified uniform shape).  
  - Allow rotation and zoom; use clean controls (buttons styled with Tailwind CSS using text labels only).

### API Integration

- In `page.tsx`, add logic to:  
  • Capture image data from the webcam.  
  • Send the image via `fetch` (or axios) to the Python backend endpoint (`http://localhost:8001/api/measure`).  
  • Manage state for loading, errors, and success responses.

---

## 4. Error Handling & Best Practices

- Implement robust error handling in all API calls (network errors, invalid responses).  
- Use try-catch in async functions, and display user-friendly error messages.  
- Validate file uploads both in the backend and the frontend.
- Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop views.

---

## 5. README & Documentation Updates

- Update `README.md` with running instructions for both the frontend (Next.js) and the backend (FastAPI).  
- Include curl command examples for testing the backend API.

---

# Summary

• A new backend directory with FastAPI is created to process body measurements using OpenCV/MediaPipe.  
• A secure `/api/measure` endpoint with error handling is implemented.  
• A new Next.js route (`src/app/fitting/page.tsx`) is added for the AR uniform fitting wizard UI.  
• UI components (CameraPreview, MeasurementResult, Uniform3DViewer) are built with modern styling using Tailwind CSS.  
• The frontend captures webcam images and integrates with the Python backend.  
• Error handling and loading states are incorporated for robust user experience.  
• Detailed instructions are added to README.md for seamless integration and testing.
